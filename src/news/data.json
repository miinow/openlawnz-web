We’re collaborating with the team at Brainbox who have previously published research into ACC law and have been faced with the challenge of time-consuming manual review of cases to generate quantitative data. <\/p> <p>Our hypothesis is that the OpenLaw data platform will allow a research team to extract meaningful and useful data, much more quickly and effectively, and at scale. <\/p> <p>We will import the ACC data set onto the OpenLaw platform, and work with the research team to build a pilot advanced research interface. The work will be published as a research report, and the data that we extract as part of the process will become available through the OpenLaw search and API.<\/p><p>The project is funded under the Law Foundation’s Information Law and Policy Project, and we are very grateful for its support and assistance. <\/p>",

          "summary": "In July 2019, OpenLaw NZ put out a call for volunteers who would be interested in helping contribute to the platform. We sought front end web developers, people experienced with data parsing and machine learning, devops and infrastructure, design and law students or lawyers. The response was fantastic and we now have a team of 20 volunteers.",
